# Dice-Roller
Working on my dice roller application

I want to build this diceroller into an application that I can use on my phone/tablet to roll dice for my D&D/Pathfinder games I run and play in. While I love rolling physical dice, I figured this would be a great first large scale project to put my new Python skills to use building.

So far it only rolls a D20 and repeats it over and over, but I will continue to build it out as my skillset increases.

I know there are apps already out there, but I am trying to build mine from scratch and using only my own code.

I hope you enjoy it!
